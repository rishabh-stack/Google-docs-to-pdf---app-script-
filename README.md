# Google-docs-to-pdf-(app-script)
This is a simple Google App Script to convert all Google Docs or Google Sheets documents in a folder to PDF.

No downloads are required as this is all done within the Google Drive application. You only need to provide folder IDs for the document root folder and the destination folder for the PDFs. The script will convert all Google documents in the root folder.
